## Q&A on solidarity with Ukraine, sanctions against Russia and Belarus, and the status of athletes from these countries.

On March 21, 2023, International Olympics Committee (IOC) published a Q&A on solidarity with Ukraine, sanctions against
Russia and Belarus, and the status of athletes from these countries.

Short Summary:

* The IOC is considering allowing individual athletes from Russia and Belarus to take part in international sports
  competitions as neutral athletes, taking into account the “serious concerns” expressed by two Special Rapporteurs of
  the UN Human Rights Council.
* The IOC is committed to the unifying mission of the Olympic Movement, to unite the entire world in peaceful
  competition.
* There are different views in the Olympic Movement moving forward, but the IOC’s exploration enjoys the overwhelming
  support of their umbrella body, the National Olympic Committees (NOCs), and the International Federations (IFs).
* Threatening a boycott of the Olympic Games, which the NOC of Ukraine is currently considering, goes against the
  fundamentals of the Olympic Movement and the principles it stands for.
* The IOC stands steadfast with the Ukrainian Olympic community.
* The IOC rejects in the strongest possible terms defamatory statements of this kind made by some Ukrainian officials.
* The Olympic Movement remains steadfast in its commitment to help the Ukrainian athletes in every way possible, because
  we all want to see a strong team from the National Olympic Committee of Ukraine at the Olympic Games Paris 2024 and
  the Olympic Winter Games Milano Cortina 2026.
* The IOC remains committed to the mission to unite the entire world in peaceful competition.
* The overwhelming majority of the Olympic Movement, including the athletes, National Olympic Committees and
  International Federations, support the unwavering solidarity with Ukraine, the sanctions imposed on Russia and Belarus
  and the peace-building, unifying mission of the Olympic Movement.

## The Goal of this Campaign

Our goal is for the International Olympic Committee to completely ban athletes from Russia and Belarus from
participating in the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris. No competing under a ‘neutral flag’. Complete ban.

## Who Drives And Supports This Campaign

**Volodymyr Zelenskyy**

_President of Ukraine_

> While Russia kills and terrorises, representatives of the terrorist state have no place at sports and Olympic
> competitions.
>
> Russian athletes have “no place” at next year’s Paris Olympics while their country’s invasion of Ukraine continues,
> Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told a summit of sports officials from 36 countries.
>
> How many Russian athletes have spoken out to condemn the terror unleashed by their state?” Zelensky told the ministers
> according to a transcript of his remarks, released by his office. “In fact, there is almost no such condemnation. There
> are only a few isolated voices that are fading away.
>
> And it cannot be covered up with some pretended neutrality or a white flag. Because Russia is now a country that
> stains everything with blood – even the white flag. It must be recognised. And this must be recognised, in particular,
> at the level of the International Olympic Committee.
>
> The International Olympic Committee needs honesty. Honesty it has unfortunately lost. Honesty that will help stop
> Russian terror and bring peace closer.

**Vasyl Myroshnychenko**

_Ukrainian Ambassador to Australia_

> We know how important it is for Russia to have their athletes perform.
>
> That’s one of the reasons why we see how much Russia has invested in their athletes for the Olympics when they were
> doping them on a massive scale and then Russia was eventually fined for that.
>
> So, Russians are really paying a great deal of attention to the performance of their athletes and this is pretty much
> an extension of their foreign policy, an extension of what they want to convey to the world.

**Dmytro Kuleba**

_Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine_

> The efforts of the IOC to sweep Russian war crimes under the rug is a testament to how far the Olympic gods have
> become detached from reality. The IOC is willing to trample on the graves of thousands of innocent people who have been
> and are being killed by Russians.
>
> IOC has been disregarding Russian war crimes, claiming that “No athlete should be prevented from competing just
> because of their passport”, while Ukrainian athletes continue to be killed by Russia because of their passports. I urge
> all sports figures to make their stance known.

**Vadym Gutzeit**

_Ministry of Youth and Sports (Ukraine)_

> Ukraine’s sports minister said his country was marshaling allies to press the International Olympic Committee to bar
> Russian and Belarusian athletes.
>
> If Ukraine failed to persuade international sports officials to bar Russian athletes, the country would, in his
> opinion, have to “skip the Olympic Games”.
>
> "The participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes in international competitions will make it impossible for
> Ukrainian athletes to take part in them because each of the Ukrainians suffered from Russian aggression in one way or
> another: they lost their relatives and friends, lost their homes, received psychological trauma, lost the opportunity to
> do what they love,” wrote Mr Guttsait, who also leads the Ukrainian Olympic Committee.

(Joint statement)

> We also noted that through their choices, action and ongoing invasion Russia broke the Olympic Truce that has been
> continuously supported by the United Nations General Assembly since 1993.
>
> We agreed that the IOC’s proposal on exploring a pathway back to competition for individual Russian and Belarusian
> athletes raises many questions and concerns.
>
> As long as these fundamental issues and the substantial lack of clarity and concrete detail on a workable ‘neutrality’
> model are not addressed, we do not agree that Russian and Belarusian athletes should be allowed back into competition.
> Noting the IOC’s stated position that no final decisions have been made, we strongly urge the IOC to address the
> questions identified by all countries and reconsider its proposal accordingly.

## Why We Do It

* Russia and Belarus have violated international law and committed human rights abuses and war crimes. Allowing their
  athletes to compete without consequences sends the message that these actions are acceptable and normalizes them.
* Through their choices, action and ongoing invasion Russia broke the Olympic Truce that has been continuously supported
  by the United Nations General Assembly since 1993.
* UN experts expressed concerns about non-discrimination and the importance of abiding by international human rights
  norms. However, allowing Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete without consequences would go against these norms.
* Allowing Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete without consequences would be disrespectful to Ukraine and the
  Ukrainian people, who have suffered greatly from the war.
* Allowing Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete without consequences would undermine the integrity of the Olympic
  Games and call into question the IOC's commitment to fair play and sportsmanship.
* Allowing Russian and Belorusian athletes to participate in the Olympic Games while more than 230 Ukrainian athletes,
  trainers and support staff were killed by Russian forces in the war caused by Russia and Belarus is not fair and
  disrespectful to Ukraine and its people.
* National pride and identity can still be associated with individual athletes, even if they are technically competing
  under a neutral flag.
* By competing under a ‘neutral flag’ Russia and Belarus can still enjoy the economic and political benefits of
  participating in the Olympics, such as increased international attention, even if their athletes are competing under a
  neutral flag. This could potentially allow Russia and Belarus to invest more in the war against Ukraine.
* By competing under a ‘neutral flag’, Russian athletes, teams and associations, through taxes paid from sponsorships
  and medals will help to sustain the Russian economy and directly fund the genocide of Ukrainians and war.
* As seen in the Australian Open tournament, even though athletes participated under a ‘neutral flag’, many fans and
  members of the Russian communities attended the tournament and showed support for the war against Ukraine by waving
  flags and wearing symbols of military aggression.
* It is imperative that we do not allow Russian and Belorussian athletes to participate in the Olympic Games. This is
  especially important in light of the hybrid informational war and propaganda led by Russia and Belorussia; allowing
  their athletes to participate would only serve to whitewash the actions of these countries and draw attention away
  from the crimes they have committed against Ukraine and its people.
* Russian weaponises sport and will use the Olympics for internal propaganda to convince Russians that they are doing
  the right thing and to motivate Russian soldiers to continue committing atrocities.
